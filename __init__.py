# __init__.py

# This file marks the directory as a Python package.

# You can optionally import key functions or classes here 
# so they can be accessed directly from the package name.

# Example: If you have a file 'src/data_processing.py' with a function 'clean_data', 
# you could import it here:
# from .data_processing import clean_data

# For this prediction project, keeping it minimal is usually best.
# We will define the main structure in the other files (e.g., app.py or a model_utils.py). 

# Pass (empty file)
